<p>Key Messages:<br />
Well done! You're taking proactive steps to prioritize your mental well-being.<br />
Reaching out for support shows real courage and resilience.<br />
Remember, your mental health is important, and you don't have to go through this alone.<br />
Feel free to utilize the various supports available, including professional services.<br />
You've got this! Keep making your mental health a top priority.</p>
<p>How to deal with annoying people:<br />
"Avoid them like the plague and when I have to do with them, remind myself not to react and just be diplomatic and nice to them, to try to make the time I have with them as limited as possible, without being rude." - quora user</p>
<p>How to deal with financial loss:<br />
"I am so sorry for your loss.<br />
I will tell you what my mom would say every time something similar happened. She would say that YOU are ok, YOU are not harmed, the DRIVER is ok and the loss is only MATERIAL. When you lose something 'material' you can earn it back. It might take time but you can get it again. But if you are injured, you can't get back your health.<br />
I know that you're upset about the loss of your dream that you worked hard for, I am sorry for that, but please don't fall into a depression because of it. Money comes and goes and is not in your hands but your mental health is in your hand and is more important." - quora user</p>
<p>Playing video games:<br />
Playing violent games and horrible games can reduce the pressure. Watching these kind of movies work as well.</p>
<p>Listening to New centery music:<br />
